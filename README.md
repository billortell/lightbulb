# Lightbulb #

A CMS of some sort is pretty much required for modern web development no matter what size site you are working on. Gone are the days of updating endless HTML files when a simple design change is needed. I created Lightbulb to be as minimal as possible. It provides all of the benefits of a CMS platform without the overhead of other bloated systems.

## WHY USE IT? ##

The most basic goal of a CMS is to take a predefined template and auto generate HTML pages with content. That is exactly what Lightbulb does, no more, no less. It is extremely lightweight and requires no SQL database or complicated backend. There is no lengthy configuration, no security concerns, etc, etc... Lightbulb provides the simplest method for fulfilling the basic duty of a CMS.
